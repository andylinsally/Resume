# UI/UX Portfolio Website

This is a static HTML and CSS implementation of a UI/UX portfolio website based on the provided Figma design.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure
- `style.css`: The CSS styles with scaling to 1440px width
- `img/`: Directory for images (placeholders used as actual images couldn't be extracted from Figma)

## Scaling

The original design was 1200px wide. All dimensions have been scaled by 1.2x to fit 1440px width.

## Images

Since the Figma design uses SVG icons and no actual image assets, placeholder image references are used in the HTML. You may need to replace them with actual PNG images.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.
